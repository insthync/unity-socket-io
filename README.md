# unity-socket-io
Socket IO implementation based on [socket.io-client-csharp](https://github.com/doghappy/socket.io-client-csharp) project

It is using my [fork version](https://github.com/insthync/socket.io-client-csharp) which uses Newtonsoft JSON as main JSON serializer

It is under-development, plan to add wrapper to make it works with WebGL builds too.
